#### Description:


## Overview
The Job Application Tracker is a web application designed to help users track their job applications. It provides a Kanban-style interface to manage job statuses and facilitates organizing and monitoring the application process.


## Features
- User Management:
  - Register a new user account
  - Log in and log out
  - Update user profile

- Job Management:
  - Create, view, update, and delete job entries
  - Track job details such as title, location, and status

- Kanban Board:
  - Visualize job statuses using a Kanban board layout
  - Drag and drop jobs between different status columns
  - Update job status with a Kanban board interface

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python, Flask framework
- Database: SQLite
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap


## New Skills and Research
- Backend Development:  I learned Flask, a Python web framework, to handle the backend development of the application.

- Database Integration: I improve my understanding of SQLite and its integration with Flask, which was necessary for managing the database operations in a easy way.

- Frontend Techniques: Research frontend techniques for implementing a Kanban board, such as incorporating drag and drop functionality using jQuery.


## Project Outcomes
- Good Outcome: Implementing a working Kanban board that allows users to track job applications and update their statuses. (current state)
- Better Outcome: Enhancing the application with additional features like filtering, and sorting options for jobs.
- Best Outcome: Building a job scraper that aggregates job postings from various platforms, providing a centralized hub for users to explore and apply to job opportunities.
